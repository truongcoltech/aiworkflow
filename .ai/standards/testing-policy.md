# Testing Policy — V1.0

## Test type matrix

| Change type | Unit | Integration | Contract | Migration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| New service method | ✅ required | — | — | — |
| New API endpoint | ✅ auth + validation | ✅ happy path | — | — |
| New background worker / job | ✅ dispatch logic | ✅ queue behavior | — | — |
| New DB table / column | — | — | — | ✅ required |
| Shared type / contract change | ✅ all callers compile | — | ✅ required | — |
| Bug fix | ✅ regression required | — | — | — |
| Auth / permission change | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| External integration (API client, webhook) | ✅ | ✅ mocked external | — | — |

<!-- Fill: extend this matrix with project-specific change types after repo-scan -->

## Unit test rules

- Mock all external calls: DB, external APIs, message queues, HTTP clients.
- Never hit real infrastructure in unit tests.
- Test: happy path, validation errors, boundary conditions, auth failures.

## Integration test rules

- Use a real test DB — never mock the database in integration tests.
  (Mocked-DB tests can pass while real migrations fail — integration tests catch this.)
- Mock external HTTP and third-party API calls.
- New API endpoints: test 401 (no token), 403 (wrong tenant/permission), happy path.

## Migration tests

- Every migration must be tested: apply runs cleanly, spot-check row counts and schema shape.
- Document explicitly if a migration is irreversible.

## Contract tests

- Required when a type from the shared types module changes.
- All modules importing the changed type must compile and their tests must pass after the change.

## Regression rule

- Bug fixes must include a test that would have caught the bug before the fix.
- Skipping a required test must be explained in DONE WHEN with explicit justification.

## Test location

| Type | Location |
|---|---|
| Unit | Co-located `<file>.test.<ext>` or `__tests__/` adjacent to source |
| Integration | `tests/integration/<module>/` |
| Migration | `tests/migrations/` |
