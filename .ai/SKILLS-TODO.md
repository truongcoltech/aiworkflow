# SKILLS-TODO.md — Tech stack registry

Auto-filled by repo-scan. Updated by Claude during work when new info is discovered.

## Rule for Claude
- ❓ = unknown. If a task requires this info: ask human once, then fill here + update relevant skill file.
- ✅ = confirmed. Use directly.
- When human answers an ❓: update status to ✅ and fill value immediately.

## Stack

Stability levels:
- `core` — stable for the life of the repo. Fill once from repo-scan. Never re-detect.
- `module` — stable per module. Fill when first touching that module.

| Role | Stability | Status | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary language | core | ❓ | — |
| Runtime / framework | core | ❓ | — |
| Package manager | core | ❓ | — |
| Build tool | core | ❓ | — |
| Test framework | core | ❓ | — |
| Frontend framework | core | ❓ | — |
| CSS approach | core | ❓ | — |
| Database | core | ❓ | — |
| ORM / query builder | module | ❓ | — |
| Auth pattern | module | ❓ | — |
| Deployment target | module | ❓ | — |

**Rule:** If all rows needed for a task are `core` ✅, skip loading SKILLS-TODO.md for that task entirely.
