# AI Routing — V1.0

## Entry point — role detection

Every message goes through role detection first. Role determines context loaded and output produced.

```text
Message received
  → Detect role from message intent

  ARCHITECT signals:
    design · plan · architect · break down · generate tasks
    review and propose · brainstorm · analyze
    how should we · what's the approach · what should we

  EXECUTOR signals:
    implement · fix · build · add · create · write
    refactor · update <thing> · change <thing>

  Ambiguous → ARCHITECT (default — plan before acting)
```

## Context loaded by role

| Role | Loads | Does NOT load |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ARCHITECT** | Full `.ai/AGENTS.md` + read order per triage level | `exec-context.md` |
| **EXECUTOR** | `exec-context.md` + task CONTEXT files + standards | `.ai/AGENTS.md` |
| **EXECUTOR (bug fix)** | `exec-context.md` + grep `LESSONS.md` + grep `DECISIONS.md` + standards | `.ai/AGENTS.md` |

---

## Architect flow

```text
ARCHITECT role
  → Load .ai/AGENTS.md
  → Triage (TRIVIAL / SIMPLE / STANDARD / EPIC)

  TRIVIAL:
    → Implement directly (no task file)
    → Human reviews diff → commit → push

  SIMPLE:
    → Generate 2-section task note
    → Human runs → executor
    → Human reviews diff → commit → push

  STANDARD / EPIC:
    → Generate task files + execution plan
    → Human runs code-edit group → executor
    → Human runs shell group → terminal (if needed)
    → Human reviews diff → batch commit → push
```

## Executor flow

```text
EXECUTOR role
  → Load exec-context.md
  → Read task file (TASK, CONTEXT, STEPS, DONE WHEN, DOC UPDATE, COMMIT)
  → Load applicable standards (per exec-context.md standards table)
  → [Bug fix only] grep LESSONS.md + DECISIONS.md for affected module
  → Implement STEPS
  → Validate all DONE WHEN + standards gates
  → Report using exec-context.md output format
```

## Roles

| Actor | Role | Context loaded |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude (architect) | Design, triage, task generation, execution plan | `.ai/AGENTS.md` + triage-level read order |
| Claude (executor) | Implement task directly when message is execution-intent | `exec-context.md` + task CONTEXT + standards |
| Codex / Cursor / Cline | Code edits — external executor tools | `exec-context.md` + task CONTEXT + standards |
| Shell runner | Shell tasks — Cline or terminal | Task file only |
| Human | Gate: watch scope, diff review, auth/schema skim, PR approve | — |

## Model routing

<!-- Filled by setup wizard. Selected table based on {{MODEL_BUDGET}}. -->

`{{MODEL_ROUTING}}`

**Rule:** Never use Opus for TRIVIAL or SIMPLE tasks. Never upgrade model without updating this table.

---

## Human gates

| Gate | When |
| --- | --- |
| Watch executor | Always — abort if scope drifts |
| Diff review | Before every commit |
| Task skim | Auth / schema tasks only |

---

## Setup flow (one-time per project)

```text
Human: "setup ai workflow"
  → Run .ai/workflows/setup.md
  → Interview (10 questions, fewer for solo)
  → Generate: .ai/AGENTS.md + exec-context.md + routing.md + SKILLS-TODO.md + ARCHITECTURE.md

  NEW PROJECT:
    → Generate skeletons with placeholders
    → SKILLS-TODO.md all ❓
    → Fill progressively during work

  EXISTING PROJECT:
    → Run .ai/workflows/repo-scan.md
    → Pre-flight conflict check → human confirms
    → Merge/replace per strategy → fill SKILLS-TODO.md + exec-context.md from scan
```

---

## File merge strategy (existing projects)

| File/folder | On adopt |
| --- | --- |
| `.ai/AGENTS.md` | Source of truth — merge filled values, keep project constraints |
| `.ai/exec-context.md` | Auto-generated — regenerate from AGENTS.md after merge |
| `.ai/workflows/*.md` | Replace |
| `.ai/routing.md` | Replace |
| `.ai/SKILLS-TODO.md` | Generate fresh |
| `.ai/skills/*.md` | Append only |
| `.ai/tasks/**` | Never touch |
| `.ai/memory/**` | Never touch |
| `docs/**` | Never touch |
| `.ai/module-map.md` | Never touch |

---

## Optional scripts

```bash
pnpm validate-all     # batch EPIC sanity check
pnpm docs-sync        # pre-PR doc check
pnpm lint-workflows   # workflow drift check
```

## Doc paths

| What | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Module registry | `docs/CUTOFF.md` |
| Architecture | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Decisions | `docs/DECISIONS.md` |
| Changelog | `docs/CHANGELOG.md` |
| Lessons | `docs/LESSONS.md` |
| Skills | `.ai/skills/{module}.md` |
